/**
 * The multiSelectionSoundPlayerFactory singleton is used to create sound players that are similar but slightly
 * different, and can be used to sonically indicate that a selection is being made from a group of available options.
 * It was originally called radioButtonSoundPlayerFactory, but its usage was expanded to to combo boxes, so the name was
 * generalized.  It may be appropriate to use in other contexts as well.
 *
 * By providing a factory for these sound players, we can avoid having to construct unique instances for each case where
 * a sound player is needed, thus conserving memory and minimizing load time.
