/**
 * PeakDetectorAudioNode is a Web Audio node that can be used to detect peak audio output values in an audio signal
 * chain.  The detected peak audio values are output to the console.  This file contains the portion that runs in the
 * main JavaScript thread, which is referred to as the "AudioWorklet Node" in the online documentation.  There is a
 * counterpart portion that runs in the Web Audio rendering thread that is referred to as the "AudioWorklet Processor".
 *
 * This is intended for diagnostic purposes only, and should not be included in production code.  It likely won't work
 * in built code anyway, since it makes a direct file reference for including the worklet processor code.
 *
 * Also note that as of this writing (Apr 2021), audio worklets are not supported in Safari.
 *
 * To use, create an instance and connect the node whose output you want to measure.  Example:
 *
 *    const peakDetector = new PeakDetectorAudioNode();
 *    this.masterGainNode.connect( peakDetector );
 *
 * TODO: !!! This does not work on all of PhET's supported platforms, so it should not be incorporated into any
 *       production code.  It should be used for debugging only.  See https://github.com/phetsims/tambo/issues/133#issuecomment-861042659.
