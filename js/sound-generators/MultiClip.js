/**
 * MultiClip is a sound generator that plays one-shot sounds from a set of pre-recorded files that are provided upon
 * construction. This is often used as a base class for a sound generator when a finite set of sounds clips need to be
 * played in response to different values of a model parameter.
 *
 * Individual gain controls are not provided for the different sound clips in this class, there is just a single gain
 * node for the sound generator as a whole.  The intent here is that this saves resources by not creating unneeded gain
 * nodes.  If such fine-grained control is needed, a similar type could be created using multiple instances of the
 * SoundClip class.
 *
 * This class only supports clips that are played as one shots, i.e. it does not include support for looping.
