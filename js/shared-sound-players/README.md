This directory contains sound players that are shared between multiple instances of a class that needs to produce the
same sound or sounds in all instances, such as a checkbox or push button. Sharing the sound player reduces memory
consumption and load time versus creating separate instances of the player in each instance of the class that is using
the sound.
